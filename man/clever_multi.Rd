\usage{
clever_multi(
  X,
  projection = "PCA_kurt",
  nuisance = cbind(1, dct_bases(nrow(X), 4)),
  center = TRUE,
  scale = TRUE,
  comps_mean_dt = TRUE,
  comps_var_dt = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Wide numeric data matrix (\eqn{T observations \times V variables}, 
\eqn{T << V}). If \code{X} represents an fMRI run, \eqn{T} should be the 
number of timepoints and \eqn{V} should be the number of brainordinate 
vertices/voxels. The outlyingness of the rows in \code{X} will be measured.}

\item{projection}{Leverage works by projecting the data onto directions likely to 
 contain outlier information. Choose at least one of the following:

 \describe{
   \item{\code{"PCA"}}{PCA using the top \eqn{k} PCs.}
   \item{\code{"PCA_kurt"}}{PCA using the high-kurtosis PCs among the top \eqn{k}.}
   \item{\code{"PCA2"}}{PCA using the top \eqn{k2} PCs.}
   \item{\code{"PCA2_kurt"}}{PCA using the high-kurtosis PCs among the top \eqn{k2}.}
   \item{\code{"PCATF"}}{PCATF using the top \eqn{k} trend-filtered PCs.}
   \item{\code{"PCATF_kurt"}}{PCATF using the high-kurtosis trend-filtered PCs among the top \eqn{k}.}
   \item{\code{"PCATF2"}}{PCATF using the top \eqn{k2} trend-filtered PCs.}
   \item{\code{"PCATF2_kurt"}}{PCATF using the high-kurtosis trend-filtered PCs among the top \eqn{k2}.}
   \item{\code{"ICA"}}{ICA using the top \eqn{k} ICs.}
   \item{\code{"ICA_kurt"}}{ICA using the high-kurtosis ICs among the top \eqn{k}.}
   \item{\code{"ICA2"}}{ICA using the top \eqn{k2} ICs.}
   \item{\code{"ICA2_kurt"}}{ICA using the high-kurtosis ICs among the top \eqn{k2}.}
 }

 where \eqn{k} is the number of PCs selected by PESEL, and \eqn{k2} is the number
 of PCs with above-average variance.
 
 Use \code{"all"} to use all projection methods. Default: \code{"PCA_kurt"}.}

\item{nuisance}{Nuisance signals to regress from each column of \code{X}.
 Should be a \eqn{T \times N} numeric matrix where \eqn{N} represents the
 number of nuisance signals. Default: a matrix with a constant column
 (this is the intercept term in the design matrix) and four DCT bases. 
 This default nuisance regression will have the effect of detrending the
 data by removing low-frequency components. To not perform any nuisance
 regression set this argument to \code{NULL}, \code{0}, or \code{FALSE}.

 Detrending is highly recommended for time-series data, especially if there 
 are many time points or evolving circumstances affecting the data. Additionally,
 if kurtosis is being used to select the projection directions, trends can 
 induce positive or negative kurtosis, contaminating the connection between 
 high kurtosis and outlier presence. Detrending should not be used with 
 non-time-series data because the observations are not temporally related.

 To perform nuisance regression with an intercept, DCT bases, and additional
 signals, specify something like \code{cbind(1, dct_bases(nrow(X), 4), more_nuisance)}.}

\item{center}{Center the columns of the data by their medians, and scale the
 columns of the data by their median absolute distances (MADs)? Default: \code{TRUE}. 
 Centering is necessary for computing the projections, so if \code{center} is
 \code{FALSE}, the data must already be centered.

 Note that centering and scaling occur after nuisance regression, so even if
 \code{center} is \code{FALSE}, the data will be centered on the means if
 the nuisance regression included an intercept term, as it does by default.}

\item{scale}{Center the columns of the data by their medians, and scale the
 columns of the data by their median absolute distances (MADs)? Default: \code{TRUE}. 
 Centering is necessary for computing the projections, so if \code{center} is
 \code{FALSE}, the data must already be centered.

 Note that centering and scaling occur after nuisance regression, so even if
 \code{center} is \code{FALSE}, the data will be centered on the means if
 the nuisance regression included an intercept term, as it does by default.}

\item{comps_mean_dt}{Stabilize the mean and variance of the PCA, 
PCATF, and ICA components prior to computing leverage? \code{TRUE} (default), 
\code{FALSE}, or the number of DCT bases to use for mean and variance detrending 
(\code{TRUE} will use 2). Note that these refer to the projection scores and 
not the data itself. Also, if scaling but not centering, the components must
be expected to already be centered; otherwise, the results will be invalid.}

\item{comps_var_dt}{Stabilize the mean and variance of the PCA, 
PCATF, and ICA components prior to computing leverage? \code{TRUE} (default), 
\code{FALSE}, or the number of DCT bases to use for mean and variance detrending 
(\code{TRUE} will use 2). Note that these refer to the projection scores and 
not the data itself. Also, if scaling but not centering, the components must
be expected to already be centered; otherwise, the results will be invalid.}

\item{kurt_quantile}{Only applies to PCA and ICA leverage. What cutoff quantile
for kurtosis should be used to select the components? Default: \code{0.99}.}

\item{PCATF_kwargs}{Arguments to \code{\link{PCATF}} in list form. Valid
entries are:

\describe{
  \item{lambda}{Trend-filtering parameter. Default: \code{5}.}
  \item{niter_max}{Maximum number of iterations. Default: \code{1000}.}
  \item{TOL}{Convergence tolerance parameter. Default: \code{1e-8}.}
  \item{verbose}{Print updates? Default: \code{FALSE}.}
}}

\item{get_dirs}{Do the projection directions need to be returned? This is the 
\eqn{V} matrix in PCA and \eqn{S} matrix in ICA. The default is \code{FALSE}
to save memory. However, \code{get_dirs==TRUE} is required for \code{\link{lev_images}}.}

\item{full_PCA}{Only applies to the PCA projection. Return the full SVD? 
Default: \code{FALSE} (return only the components used to compute the measures).}

\item{get_outliers}{Should outliers be flagged based on \code{cutoff}? Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cutoff}{Median leverage cutoff value. Default: \code{4}.}

\item{verbose}{Should occasional updates be printed? Default: \code{FALSE}.}
}

 \item{outlier_flag}{A \eqn{T \times P} data.frame of logical values where \code{TRUE} indicates suspected outlier presence.}
 \item{mask}{
   A length \eqn{P} numeric vector corresponding to the data locations in \code{X}. Each value indicates whether the location was masked:
   \describe{
     \item{1}{The data location was not masked out.}
     \item{-1}{The data location was masked out, because it had at least one \code{NA} or \code{NaN} value.}

     \item{nPCs_PESEL}{The number of PCs selected by PESEL.}
     \item{nPCs_avgvar}{The number of above-average variance PCs.}
   }
   where \code{Q} is the number of PCs selected by PESEL or of above-average variance (or the greater of the two if both were used). 
   If PCA was not used, all entries except \code{nPCs_PESEL} and/or \code{nPCs_avgvar} will not be included, depending on which
   method(s) was used to select the number of PCs.

\description{
Calculates leverage to identify outliers in high-dimensional data. 
 Can compute multiple kinds of leverage at once.
}
\section{Order of operations}{

 The input data undergo a nuisance regression to remove low frequency trends
 (see the \code{DCT} argument to control or disable this behavior) and any
 other nuisance signals (see the \code{nuisance_too} argument to specify them).
 (If \code{DCT==0} and \code{is.null(nuisance_too)}, no nuisance regression 
 is performed.) Then the data are centered and scaled (see the \code{center}
 and \code{scale} arguments to control or disable this behavior). Leverage
 is computed afterward.
