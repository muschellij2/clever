\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A numerical matrix.}

}
\description{
Centers and scales the columns of a matrix robustly for the purpose of 
 covariance estimation.

absolute deviation (MAD). If any column MAD is zero, its values become zero
and a warning is raised. If all MADs are zero, an error is raised.
