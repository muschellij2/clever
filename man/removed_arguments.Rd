\arguments{
\item{measures}{Character vector indicating the measures to compute. Choose 
 at least one of the following: 

 \describe{
   \item{\code{"leverage"}}{Leverage scrubbing, which is based on
     projecting the data onto directions thought to express outlier 
     information.}
   \item{\code{"robdist"}}{Robust Mahalanobis-based distance}
   \item{\code{"DVARS"}}{Traditional DVARS}
   \item{\code{"DVARS2"}}{Delta-percent-DVARS and z-score-DVARS (Afyouni and 
     Nichols, 2018)}
   \item{\code{"FD"}}{Framewise Displacement. Requires \code{motion}.}
   \item{\code{"motion"}}{Translation and rotation realignment parameters. 
     Requires \code{motion}.}
   \item{\code{"GSR"}}{Global Signal of the data.}
 }

 Use \code{"all"} to select all available measures. (FD and motion will only 
 be computed if the motion realignment parameters are provided.) Default: 
 \code{"leverage", "DVARS2"}.

 Note that motion and GSR are not direct measures of outlyingness,
 so they do not have corresponding \code{outlier_cutoffs}.}

\item{motion}{Only used if the \code{"FD"} measure is requested. An 
 \eqn{N \times 6} matrix in which the first three columns represent the
 translational realignment parameters (mm), and the second three columns represent
 the rotational realignment parameters in (radians). To convert radians to mm,
 the displacement on a sphere of radius 50 mm will be computed.

 Alternatively, this can be the file path to an \eqn{N \times 6} matrix which can be
 read with \code{\link{read.table}} (fields separated by white-space; no
 header).}

\item{noise_nPC}{Only applies to CompCor.
 The number of principal components to compute for each noise
 ROI. Alternatively, values between 0 and 1, in which case they will 
 represent the minimum proportion of variance explained by the PCs used for
 each noise ROI. The smallest number of PCs will be used to achieve this 
 proportion of variance explained. 

 Should be a list or numeric vector with the same length as \code{ROI_noise}. 
 It will be matched to each ROI based on the name of each entry, or if the 
 names are missing, the order of entries. If it is an unnamed vector, its
 elements will be recycled. Default: \code{5} (compute the top 5 PCs for 
 each noise ROI).}

\item{noise_erosion}{Only applies to CompCor.
 The number of voxel layers to erode the noise ROIs by. 

 Should be a list or numeric vector with the same length as \code{ROI_noise}. 
 It will be matched to each ROI based on the name of each entry, or if the 
 names are missing, the order of entries. If it is an unnamed vector, its 
 elements will be recycled. Default: \code{NULL}, which will use a value of
 0 (do not erode the noise ROIs).}

\item{DCT}{Detrend the columns of the data using the discrete cosine
 transform (DCT)? Use an integer to indicate the number of cosine bases to 
 use for detrending. Use \code{0} (default) to forgo detrending. 

 The data must be centered, either before input or with \code{center}.

 Detrending is highly recommended for time-series data, especially if there 
 are many time points or evolving circumstances affecting the data. Additionally,
 if kurtosis is being used to select the projection directions, trends can 
 induce positive or negative kurtosis, contaminating the connection between 
 high kurtosis and outlier presence. 
 
 Detrending should not be used with non-time-series data because the 
 observations are not temporally related.}

\item{PESEL}{Leverage is based on the largest \eqn{k} PCA, ICA, or PCATF 
 components. \code{k} can be determined by PESEL with \code{\link[pesel]{pesel}}
 (default, \code{PESEL==TRUE}). Otherwise, \eqn{k} will be the number of 
 above-average-variance PCs (\code{PESEL==FALSE}). In either case, \code{k}
 is calculated based on PCA, even to select the number of ICA and PCATF
 components.  

 Note that not all \code{k} components are ultimately used: only components with
 high kurtosis (> 99th percentile of the kurtosis of data of equal length 
 from a Normal distribution) contribute to the leverage calculation.}

\item{nuisance_too}{A matrix of nuisance signals to regress from the data
before, i.e. a "design matrix." Should have \eqn{T} rows. Nuisance
regression will be performed simultaneously with DCT detrending if 
applicable. \code{NULL} (default) to not add additional nuisance regressors.}
